// Auto-generated — add `gpui-kit.d.ts` to your .gitignore.
//
// The built-in modules, as TypeScript declarations, for gpui-shell 0.6.1.
// Do not edit: gpui-shell rewrites this on every run, in every directory that
// imports one of them, from the runtime that is about to execute the script. A
// committed copy could only ever be the stale one.
//
// Each built-in module names the public Rust layer it exposes, so an import
// says which layer a script depends on. "gpui-kit" also carries the shell bridge:
//
//   "gpui-kit"   GPUI's own elements, plus what this runtime adds: views,
//                the style surface, the window, storage, scheduling.
//   "gpui"       Compatibility alias for "gpui-kit".
//   "gpui-base"  gpui-base's layout helpers, components and theme.
//   "gpui-fps"   gpui-fps's performance overlay.
//
// Except for the explicit "gpui" compatibility alias, a name belongs to
// exactly one module and is not re-exported for convenience.
//
// The style surface here is generated from the same tables the runtime
// dispatches through, so a style method that type-checks exists at run time,
// and a length or color the compiler refuses is one the runtime would refuse
// too. Put `// @ts-check` at the top of a script to have an editor check it.
//
// What is not expressed: capability grants (a denied `fs.readFile` still
// type-checks), element and `cx` lifetimes (both belong to one call), and
// which component a method suits (all elements share one prototype).

   * GPUI's own lazy list: rows of any height, measured as they are drawn.
   *
   * Where `v_virtual_list` places rows by the sizes the script states, `list`
   * asks nothing about size. `render(index, cx)` is called for each item that
   * is on screen, from inside layout as a virtual list's renderer is, and the
   * element it returns is measured; the list keeps those measurements and
   * estimates the rest, so a collection of panels that size to their own
   * content scrolls as one and costs the script only what is visible. The
   * rules of a virtual list's renderer apply unchanged: no handlers and no
   * retained state inside it, and `cx.notify()` is refused there.
   *
   * The list scrolls itself and paints no scrollbar; pair one with it by name,
   * as with a scroll area:
   *
   * ```js
   * v_flex().relative().flex_1().min_h(0)
   *   .child(list("panels", this.panels.length,
   *     (index) => this.panels[index].id,
   *     (index) => this.panel(this.panels[index])))
   *   .child(Scrollbar.vertical("panels").absolute().inset_0());
   * ```
   *
   * The measuring is what it costs: the host is entered once per visible item
   * per frame, where `v_virtual_list` and `uniform_list` are entered once per
   * frame however many rows are on screen. Reach for this when heights are
   * genuinely unequal and unknown — a column of panels, a feed of mixed
   * cards — and for a long run of same-height rows reach for one of the
   * others.
   *
   * One consequence of the per-item call: `get_key`'s uniqueness is checked
   * within a call, so a `list` cannot see that two items share a key, where
   * the other two throw. A duplicate key there quietly gives both items one
   * identity, and `on_item_click` reports it for either.
   *
   * @param id      Identity, and the name a `Scrollbar` pairs with.
   * @param item_count How many items the collection has, visible or not.
   * @param get_key An item's stable domain key, from its current index; the
   *   row's element identity and what `on_item_click` reports.
   * @param render  Called with one index; returns that item's element.

   * The focus handle is a constructor argument because base requires it: the

   *
   * **Enter and Escape do not reach it.** Base's picker handles both actions
   * but sets no key context, and every key binding base installs is scoped to
   * one — so nothing matches the keystroke and `on_open_change` never fires.
   * Open and close it from a press on the trigger you drew instead, and treat
   * `on_open_change` as wired for the day that changes. A `Select` does not
   * have this problem; if you need the keyboard today, build the picker's
   * trigger and calendar inside one.

   * `render(range, cx)` is called with the visible interval and returns one
   * element per item in it — so a ten-thousand-row list costs the script what a
   * twenty-row one costs. It is the only callback in this API that is not an
   * event handler, and the only one the host calls during a frame rather than
   * between them: GPUI decides which rows exist while it is laying the list
   * out, so the call happens from inside layout, twice per frame (once to
   * measure a representative row, once to place the visible ones).
   *
   * Two consequences follow from that, and both are enforced rather than
   * documented away:
   *
   * * **No handlers inside the renderer.** `on_click` and the rest throw if
   *   called there. Use `on_item_click` on the list — see its note for why.
   * * **No state inside the renderer.** `InputState.new()`, `cx.focus_handle()`
   *   and the rest throw there as they do in `render()`, and `cx.notify()` is
   *   refused: asking for a re-render from inside layout is a loop.
   *
   * What the layout pass does *not* cost you is the `cx` you already had: the
   * renderer is a closure inside `render(cx)`, so the row helpers written
   * against that `cx` — `label(text, cx)`, `surface(cx)` — keep working
   * unchanged. The `cx` the renderer is handed reaches the same window and app,
   * and is there for a renderer written somewhere `render`'s is not in scope.
   *
   * The list paints no scrollbar of its own. Pair one with it by name, exactly
   * as with a scroll area:
   *
   * ```js
   * v_flex().relative().h(400)
   *   .child(v_virtual_list("rows", this.rows.length, 28,
   *     (index) => this.rows[index].id,
   *     (range) => this.rows.slice(range.start, range.end).map(row => text(row.name))))
   *   .child(Scrollbar.vertical("rows").absolute().inset_0());
   * ```
   *
   * @param id      Identity, and the name a `Scrollbar` pairs with.
   * @param item_count How many items the collection has, visible or not.
   * @param item_sizes One number for a uniform extent, or one per item —
   *   heights for `v_virtual_list`, widths for `h_virtual_list`. Base takes a
   *   single vector whose *length* is also the count; splitting the two is a
   *   deliberate difference, because mirroring it would put one number per row
   *   across the language boundary on every render, and a uniform hundred
   *   thousand rows is the case worth making cheap. An array must be exactly
   *   `item_count` long.
   * @param get_key An item's stable domain key, from its current index. It is
   *   the row's element identity, and it is what `on_item_click` reports — so a
   *   click queued before a filter or a sort reordered the list still names the
   *   item whose box was pressed rather than whatever slid into that index.
   *   Required.

   *   in it.
